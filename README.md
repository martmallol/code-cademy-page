# Codecademy Home Page Clone
![Page Example](/resources/images/sample-page.jpg)
This project is my second web page attempt. I rebuilt the Codecademy Home page. It's basically a clone, and every piece of code was created by me. No line from the Codecademy's base code was copied in the process. The idea was to make the front page with my own style of coding.

## Overview
### Users should be able to
- Navigate through the home page of Codecademy. Every button is clickable and redirects you to its real-Codecademy page route. 

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learnt
- How to create different web page components such as a Navbar, a Footer, box placements.
- Style a plain HTML code with CSS.
- Capitalize the help given by Google Chrom Dev Tools.
